How should I play the game?
What is the goal? How can I "win" or "score points"?
What are the controls? Which buttons do what? Do I use  mouse or keyboard?
Indicate the 2 selfstudy elements I should grade. (add links to sources if needed)
Deliver a program that works out of the box. No errors in the console!
Put whatever doesn't work in code comments to make sure I can test that what does work.
If I open the game and immediately encounter an error, I won't fix it to still be able to test something. A game that doesn't work out of the box receives a 0 grade. Only turn in what does work.
